[computer_whirring] Come on . Let 's check the prisoners . Your attention and look this way ! ln a few minutes , we 'll be making an Earth entry . ln ten , you 'll be getting out of your bunks and moving through the Liberty Corridor . Now , you 've all been good boys so far . We 've had a nice trip . But until you get your discharge papers , let me remind you of one thing ... You are still convicts ! Which means that we do n't want any trouble in our last minutes together . I want no demonstrations , no cracks about the Interstellar Prison Service once we 've landed , no sneaky tricks of any kind . Because if you 've got anything like that in mind , there 's me , there 's my friend and there are these prods . Most of you have had a tickle or two from them . So you know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . Now , let 's check your restrainers . Think of it . In a couple of hours you 'll all be free . Back on Mother Earth , eating normal food sleeping in normal beds . Maybe sleeping with someone . Just doing what you like , when you like . And that 's something our prize specimens , our pre-criminals , will be looking forward to . Is n't that so , [Crandall] ? Prisoner [Crandall] . I spoke to you . I want an answer . What was the question , sir ? I said are you looking forward to your big event or are n't you ? - Yes . I am . - Thanks for replying . You pre-criminals are all the same , those of you who get to make the trip back . You have a look about you , a special look that says that you 're a law unto yourselves . But let me tell you something , as far as I 'm concerned , you 're not ! And with one swipe of this prod I can wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered , you 'd be taking a chance , would n't you ? No , [Crandall] , I do n't think so . You might grind your teeth , but when it comes to it I do n't think you 'd waste your special , precious licence that you 've qualified for on me . Maybe not . But all the same , do n't push so hard . Is your friend going to speak about the big event ? You gave him a tickle yesterday or had you forgotten ? So I did . But the paralysis should wear off soon . When it does , you can tell him that he can look forward to the big event then it 's his turn for fun , too . I will . But it 's no thanks to you . Better strap in . We 'll be hitting the entry shocks soon . [whirring] Otto ! Otto ! Come on , it 's nearly time ! [Henck] here , sir ! pre-criminal 525514 . Oh , Nick . What 's up ? We 're nearly home ! The ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! - How do you feel ? Sick , dizzy . The way one always feels after a touch of one of those guys ' prods . Nerves twisting about . Forget it . We 're nearly through with him . And then I was dreaming . I was dreaming when you must have touched me . About Elsa . A new way to get her . A brand new , really ugly way . Easy . Think of other things for the moment . Like food , drink , relaxation . The way I figure it , that comes later . First it 's Elsa . That ca n't be . Not just like that . We 've been away seven years . Things will have changed . First we have to adjust . What 's wrong with you Nick ? Have you turned soft ? Do n't tell me you 've forgotten about him ? No . I have n't . But it 's been a long wait . A short while longer is n't going to make all that difference . I suppose not . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Otherwise what would the last seven years have meant ? [man_over_PA] Orbital count down . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . [loud_whirring] [high_pitched_noise] [engines_roaring] Here we go Otto . Into the home stretch . Closer to your Elsa and my Stephensen ! [rumbling] [overlapping_chatter] We wo n't have long to wait for our story . pre-criminals just once in a decade that get back to Earth . Which ones are [Crandall] and [Henck] ? Wait and see . Gomez , Stephens , prisoners Class C , go to number four desk , on the right along the corridor , for your clearance and discharge . @electronic_whirring , [bleeping] Arthur and Garfinkel , prisoners class B , go to number two desk , on the left . @electronic_whirring , [bleeping] Reeves and Nation , prisoners class A , go to number three desk , on the right . @electronic_whirring , [bleeping] [Crandall] and [Henck] . pre-criminals . Go to number one desk over there . @electronic_whirring , [bleeping] [Crandall] , [Henck] , we 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them through . They have n't been discharged yet . How does it feel to be back ? I guess a few words wo n't hurt . I asked , what 's it like to be back on Earth ? Fine , just fine . What 's the first thing you 're going to do once you get your discharge ? - Eat a good meal . - And then ? Drink maybe . New clothes . And relax . Yes . But after that ? Tell us , would you care to name any names ? No . No comment . Well , that 's your privilege . Yes that 's their privilege . Now report to number one desk , the examiner is waiting . Name and detail ? Nicholas [Crandall] , number 525509 . Research engineer , advanced chemist , mechanical theorist . Correct ? Yes , sir . And now that you have served your pre-sentence , do you still want your special licence ? Yes . I do . Married then divorced . No children . Perhaps the reason for your wanting it lies there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right under the Pre-Criminal Code . Yes , sir . And you ? You must be Otto [Henck] , number 525514 ? Yes , sir . Sea farmer , married , no children . And you , [Henck] , do you still want your licence ? Yes , sir . Then let 's look at the records . Both of you appeared before the authorities seven years ago and made confessions of intent . You were sentenced and served your sentences in the outer galaxies . - Yes , sir . - Where , exactly ? Two years on Rigel 12 , another two on Antares 8 and the final three on Proxima Centaurus . It 's unusual for men to spend such long times on those planets and then return . How do you account for the fact that you both managed to survive such an ordeal ? Luck sir , and the fact that we were there together . When I was attacked by molten lava on Rigel 12 , Otto [Henck] saved me and then looked after me . Which is no more than he did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill me . So you looked after one another , served out a rough comradeship in order to survive and to qualify for the right to hold these licences ? Yes , sir . The Pre-criminal Code guarantees that you will get them . You 've served sentences equivalent to half of that which you would have received , had you committed the crime under the Normal Penal Code . But what does it achieve ? Many would-be criminals have had time to pause and reflect and then changed their minds . The result , crime incidence has been greatly reduced . That 's all very well , but what about their intended victims ? After all , Examiner , it could be you it could be me . That 's a risk we have to take for a progressive law . But what 's wrong with punishment as a straight line deterrent ? Imprisonment , whippings , executions , they were effective . If you think so and want to return to the Dark Years , you have only to take a trip back in the time machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Then keep quiet . Nicholas [Crandall] and Otto [Henck] , having regard to the work that you have achieved in helping to colonise those places in which you 've spent the last seven years , I accordingly grant you your complete discharge and your legal licences to go forth from this place and kill one [man] or one woman of your own choosing ! [cameral_clicks] How do you feel now , Mr . [Crandall] ? Mr . [Henck] ? Now that you 've got these licences ? I 'm not sure . Except maybe to hope . Hope ? Hope what ? That our victims are in good health , and waiting for us . **32;5900;TOOLONG [reporter] Can we have a personal interview for our newspaper ? Well , we 're in luck . There are several rooms vacant according to this indicator . Why pick this place , Nick ? It 's expensive . Look at those rates . Twelve credits a day . We can afford it . But I 've only got about a hundred credits all told in my token account . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend it to you . Come on let 's register ! clicking , [beeping] Right . Your turn . clicking , [beeping] The Capricorn Ritz ! I never thought I 'd be staying here . Let 's go to the bar and get ourselves that drink . Should we ? I mean all these people -- They 're minding their own business . So come on . - I just thought -- - I know . But if we want to re-join the human race , we 've got to make an effort . And a drink will help , so come on . [man_on_TV] And since the authority introduced the new tourist service on the planet , Mars , 50,000 people have taken advantage ... Well , I told you things would 've changed . Before we went away a barman used to serve the drinks . Now they 've automated him out of business . Then what do we do ? Take one and sign for it by pressing here I suppose . [beeping] , [whirring] Our signal is transmitted to a Token Bank and we get deducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all ... Too easy . This could mean ruin for me in no time . Besides , what do you do for company when you 're by yourself ? Visu-check . Always on tap . I told you things would 've changed since they sent us away . All these new things . [man_continues_on_TV] The extra thrust of the spaceship , the transporter , even this mechanical bar working day and night everywhere , and every one of them motivated by the new power source . [man_on_TV] ... has now successfully been brought back to life . Stephensen Power . Stephensen . He must be the richest [man] alive . Just about . And to think it 's your name that should have been on that marker . No wonder you feel about him the way you do . Just for the moment , let 's forget him . Instead , here 's to us . - Across the stars . - [on_TV] Back here on Earth , the convict spaceship Jean Valjean landed earlier today and discharged two pre-criminals , Nicholas [Crandall] and Otto [Henck] . Two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licences to commit one murder apiece . Take a good look at them , it might be you they 're after ! I suppose that had to happen . [man_on_TV] A fire is reported to be raging ... Come on , let 's take these drinks over there . Away from all these people . ... believe that the fire extends for 1,000 square miles ... That means everyone will be on the alert . Everyone will be watching out for us . Including our targets . As far as I am concerned , it does n't make any difference . Elsa knows ! I told her that day , just before I turned myself in . She knows I would n't take a murder rap for anyone but her ! Then you wore a fool ! That means she 'll be armed , ready to defend herself . It wo n't make any difference . I 'll get her just the same . And , what 's more , I told her on purpose . I want her to know . I wanted her to wait and squirm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick . I bet she 's had hers too . Which serves her right for the 12 years of so called marriage that she gave me before that . Using me , playing around , laughing at me . - That was a real hell , Nick . - I know . But do n't get clouded up so you ca n't think straight . Do n't worry . When it comes to the moment I wo n't mess it up , not after all that . It 's different for you , Nick . A [man] may have cheated you out of what should have been yours , but at least your wife did n't mess you up in a way that only a woman can . That 's true . My marriage was good while it lasted . Five years and then we just seemed to drift apart . - But without any real hurt . - Your wife gave you a divorce . She did n't insist on hanging on to make you suffer . Polly was all right . A bit mixed up maybe , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all there , the next it was n't . But I 've always remembered her nicely . No bad feelings there . Only for Stephensen and what he cheated me out of . Well , I 'll be darned ! Someone I know ! Paul , how are you ? Well , of all people to meet on my first day back . - How - - How are you ? - All right . Strange . I had n't expected to meet any old friends so soon . And then you and I , all those years we spent in research together . - That was a long time ago . - Seven or eight years . Well , what have you been doing in the meantime ? What are you doing now ? I 'm all right . I keep busy . I 'm - - I 'm in business . Good . I hope it 's going well . Look , I 'm with a friend so why not join us for a drink ? No thanks , as a matter of fact , I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see them coming now . Hi . - So , you see ? - Yes , I see . - You saw ... - If you 'll excuse me . - What 's up ? - Nothing . I thought I saw an old friend . ln point of fact , what I saw was an ex-friend . You and I are going to have plenty of those from how on . [laughter] Come on , let 's get out of here it 's like being in a glass bowl . That 's just what I was thinking and Nick , I 'm getting restless . I want to do something about finding Elsa right away . Yes , and I should be looking after my one too . I 'll try the apartment . Elsa should be there at this time . Yes , and I 'll call on Stephensen at the lab . That 's the most likely place . - See you back here later . - Yeah , right . - And , Otto - Yes ? - Good luck , huh ? - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's in position now . Temperature reading , 5,500 over 25 . Wait five seconds for reduction to normal , then close and activate . Five , four , three , two , one . cracking , whooshing That batch should keep up our quota . Give me an exact reading on the results later . I 'm looking for Stephensen . My name is Marshall . Roger Marshall . I 'm sorry , he 's away at the moment . But I 'm [Marie] Bell , his chief assistant . - Away ? - On vacation . At his hunting lodge in Central Tibet . Oh . But if it 's business in connection with the lab , I can speak on his behalf . When do you expect him back ? I 'm not sure . He 's liable to drop in at any moment . On the other hand , it could take a few days . Well , you see , I have some information I 'm sure would interest him . - Yes ? - I 'm a research developer . I 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of your power system . I have completed an advance which will increase the value of the power source considerably . Well , in that case , I 'm sure he 'd be interested . If you care to leave the details with me -- No , no , thank you . Thank you all the same but I think I 'd rather speak to him personally . As you wish . Is this the first time you 've seen the laboratory ? Yes . I did see it some time ago when it was in a different form . An idea on paper . The original plans ? Then that means that you 've met Mr . Stephensen before ? Yes . Way back . He would n't remember me . All the same that means you must have an idea of - what is being done here . - Yes , a fair idea . That tank there , that 's the main storage unit where the Salturian Rocks are kept when they 're brought to Earth . From there we take them and place them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stephensen Theory and the result is power that leaves through the Source Conduit at the far end . - Of course , we -- - The Stephensen Theory ? Yes . His famous theory . The one he perfected eight years ago . Of course . These laboratories are established everywhere now - on Venus on the Moon , on Mars . - On practically every colony . They provide 97 per cent of all the power used - in the Solar System . - Very impressive . For someone who walks in here and talks of an advance , you seem uncertain of what is generally known by everyone . Well , you see , I 've been working in isolation . The only way that a research developer , like myself , can arrive at abstracts which is my main field . I see . All the same , I 'm sure that Mr . Stephensen will be pleased to hear what I have to say . He 's always willing to listen to new ideas . Yes , I 've no doubt . You must derive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place like this . - Yes . I was lucky to be allowed to work at all . Most graduates from my seminar passed straight into the Leisure Group . It must be terrible not to be able to contribute as long as you live . How did you get started here ? Mr . Stephensen took an interest in me . - He 's been very kind . - I see . When he gets back , perhaps you would inform me . I can be contacted at the Capricorn Ritz room 412 . - 412 . Right . - Thank you . [door_whirs] [radio_sounds] Yes ? [man] Floor here . The batch is ready . Thank you . [door_whirs] At two credits a glass , how are you making out ? Hello . Not so bad . It 's only my third all evening . Or fourth , I do n't remember exactly . How did It go , with Elsa I mean . She was n't there . Not even the apartment . The whole district has been redeveloped . - There was n't sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you where she 's gone ? I was so shocked I did n't know what to do . That whole district was nothing but 80 tier apartment blocks as far as the eye could see . Now it 's nothing but a huge nature park . - But surely -- - The last thing I expected . I just stood in the middle of the park not knowing what to do . But even if she has moved on , there must be a record ? You do n't understand , Nick . All that time we were away , all the while , I kept thinking of how it was going to be when I finally caught up with her , the times I dreamed of it . And it always happened in that place . Now it just is n't there anymore . I 'm sorry , Nick . I was just thinking about my side of it . - How did it go with him ? - Same story , he was away . Oh . You want to have a drink ? No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'll go up to my room get some rest . - Sure . - See you in the morning , Otto . - You should get some rest too . - I will . Nick , do n't worry . It wo n't make any difference . I 'll look for Elsa , I 'll find her - and when I do -- - I know . Good night , Otto . Good night . [door_buzzes] [soft_electronic_whirring] [bleep] **27;5934;TOOLONG , quietly [spraying] [intercom_crackles] - Yes ? - Good evening , Mr . [Crandall] . I hope I 'm not disturbing you . - Who are you ? - Henson Marcus Henson of the Main Continent Media Exchange . I was at the space-port earlier today . What can I do for you , Mr . Henson ? My company is interested in your story . Very interested . Mr . Henson . I 'm tired . I 've had a long day -- And the public is excited by it . They 've been lapping up the details ever since you landed . Perhaps you 've seen our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about it ? We 'd like to follow it up get an exclusive interview from you . Not interested , I 've had a taste of being a freak . - I do n't want to cultivate it . - Do n't be hasty Mr . [Crandall] . You have n't heard our proposition yet . What proposition ? Fifty thousand credits payable to your account in the Token Bank . Fifty thousand ! That 's right . Fifty thousand for you just to tell us your story . The full story . Well , you know most of it already . I mean everything that happened to us . We want to know everything . From the moment you first went to the authorities and confessed to your pre-criminal intention . Every experience that you underwent in those terrible places you were sent to . Oh , I know you mentioned some at the spaceport but I had the feeling earlier that you were playing down some of the incidents . I answered the questions straight . I know . But we want the inside story . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to your hand ? - My hand ? - Yes . You 're wearing that surgical glove . Did you lose your hand ? And if so , how ? You see , it 's details like this the public wants to know about . But the biggest thing they want to know about , and that 's why we 're prepared to pay so much , is that special piece of information that clinches your story . - I do n't understand . - Oh , come on now ! What do you think they 're all excited about ? What do you think they 're really guessing at ? You know as well as I . They 're trying to figure out who your victim is going to be ! You tell us , we 'll follow your story , we 'll be there when it happens and you can retire a rich [man] while at the same time completing what you set out to do ! Mr . Henson , I have no intention of -- I know the code says you do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's nothing to stop you changing your mind and profiting by it . And the chances will still be on your side . Henson you 're wasting your time ! - Now if you 'll excuse me -- - Now , look , Mr . [Crandall] -- Good night , Mr . Henson . [music_begins_again] [Crandall] , inflashback Let 's get this rock out of the way , Otto . [Henck] All right . [Crandall] Get your shoulder behind it . [Crandall] Push from the other side . [Henck] That 's what I 'm doing . [Henck] It 's starting to go ! It 's moving ! [Crandall] Just a little more effort ! [Henck] There it goes ! But look out . Nick ! The lava ! Watch it ! It 'll strike ! [screaming] [Henck] Nick , what happened ? - It , it got my hand ! - [Henck] Let me see ! [Henck] , echoing What hand , Nick ? What hand ? [bell_chiming] [buzzer] Polly ! You 're that last person I expected to see . - Is that true ? - Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ex-husbands up . Nick , please do n't play games with me . - Hmm ? - Do n't be that cruel ! I know why you served your sentence . The moment I saw you presented on the journal casts last night . - I knew why you did it . - Polly , I do n't know - what you 're talking about . - Yes , you do . You knew all along . I felt it . I suppose you tell me . When we were married there was only one [man] ever ! One [man] what ? Only one that I was unfaithful with ! And I made a mistake . I thought he loved me . I would never have divorced you if I 'd known what he was really like . A first class mistake . The biggest I ever made . And because of that I 've been punished enough . So , please Nick ! Please do n't kill me ! Well , we live and learn . Nick , it was over nine years ago , eight at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make any sense . No , you 're right , it would n't . Please do n't take your revenge after all this time . Do n't worry , Polly . I wo n't . The way things happened between him and me , well , you know , the way he talks . You wo n't ? You wo n't kill me after all ? Polly you 're talking about something I know nothing about . And never did . - You did n't ? - I never realised . But I could have sworn , when I asked for divorce ... I thought it was for the reasons you gave at the time . That you just wanted to be free . Then then you would n't even know who he was ? No , and after all this time perhaps it 's better that I do n't . Are you telling me the truth ? Or are you playing with me wanting me to suffer some more ? That 's the truth , Polly . After that , I could do with a drink . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual ? Yes . [whirring] I really did think you knew all along . [beeping] No . I trusted you . It only started because you insisted on working . When you became involved with that scheme . I had time left over . Time outside the Organised Leisure Programme . I had time in which to become bored . You should have told me . You would n't have listened . You were so involved . My researches meant a lot to me . I would 've thought they 'd meant a lot to us . I know . But in the end whatever happened to them ? Come to that what happened to me ? - What do you mean ? - I loved you . Despite what I have just told you , I did love you . I made a mistake in asking for that divorce . And I have regretted it ever since . How are things with you otherwise ? All right . I live in North America , near the Great Lakes . Got a nice apartment . As you gather I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time away ? It was n't a picnic . - My mother died . Last year . - I 'm sorry to hear that . She elected of her own accord . She was feeling bored and the authority issued a voluntary pill . - I see . And your father ? - He 's fine . He still potters with his hobby . You know cultivating those Martian Blooms . Nick , I was wondering . - Could n't we ? - Oh , Polly ! Could n't we start over again just forget everything ? It 's too late . Much too late to pick up . It would n't work , and besides ... I know . You have only come back to complete one thing . Yes . Nick , I did n't ask ... I purposely did n't ask but if it is n't me you 're after , then who is it ? [bleeping] Yes ? [man_over_radio] Mr . Stephensen calling you from Tibet , Miss Bell . Go ahead , Mr . Stephensen . - [Marie] , how are you ? - Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Excellent . - What about things at the lab ? - Normal . Production is steady . We 've got plenty of reserve . Good . - When will you be back ? - Later today . - Yes , but what time ? - At ten o'clock this evening . Good . - We look forward to seeing you . - Why ? A [man] called in last evening . He has a very good research idea , which I 'm sure will interest you . I see . Then make an appointment . Thank you . - Goodbye , [Marie] . - Bye . Have a good trip back . Yes , Miss Bell ? Get me the Capricorn-Ritz Hotel , please . [man_over_PA] 4 12 to visu-phone ... Calling 4 12 . Excuse me . Yes ? [Marie] Mr . [Crandall] ? I 've heard from Mr . Stephensen . He 'll be back at 10:00 . I 've made an appointment for you . You will be there , wo n't you ? Yes , I will . Thank you . Will you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make out . I know you will , Nick . Good bye . - My wife . I mean my ex . - Oh ? She just came to say hello . Then wound up asking me who I had in mind . - You did n't tell her ? - What do you think ? How did it go with you ? First thing this morning I contacted the Movement Bureau . They gave me Elsa 's new address . - Good . - I 'm going there now . - See you later . - Sure . creaking , [beeping] Nick ! lasering , explosion Look up there on the gantry ! coughing , spluttering Find him . Here he is ! This is the [man] who fired . Daniel ! - Do you know him ? - He 's my brother ! All right let 's hear it . What 's the commotion about ? But I do n't understand . Why , Dan ? Simple , Nick . I had to get you first - But , Dan - Wait a minute ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was released yesterday ? I see . Get the blaster . I saw it all . I was up there when he aimed . Maybe you should n't have interfered . It could be entirely their own business . Now , look , I 'm going to have to take statements from you both . You both know the basic law in a situation like this . So let 's get started . Why , Dan ? What was it all about ? - You know . You 've always known . - Dan ! I tried to reach you to tell you that there was no need . - I see . - But I do n't . As I said before , you know the position in law . [Crandall] , you were a pre-criminal . You have a special licence . He fired at you . Now , if it can be proved that he had reasonable cause to believe that he was your intended victim , then he had every right to anticipate you . But if not , then he would be guilty of attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Outer Colonies . So , Mr . [Crandall] , it 's up to you . What do you have to say ? Was your brother your intended victim or not ? Well ? - Yes . Yes it was him . - You 're sure ? - That lady that came in -- - Yes , I 'm quite sure ! All right you heard what he had to say . You can let him go . He 's free . Whichever way they work it out from now on that 's their business . Or forget it and disperse . And it 's none of ours . So let 's leave ! Thanks , Otto . I did n't have time to think about it . It happened I moved . If you 're okay now , I 'll check on Elsa . Yes . I 'm all right . Polly tells me that you were lying just now . That you did so to save me from a spell on the colonies . That you never had any idea about us . No idea at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash from the Capricorn Ritz Hotel in Sahara City where , a few moments ago , an unsuccessful attempt was made on the life of the ex-pre-criminal Nicholas [Crandall] . Look , we ca n't talk here . [Crandall] stated later that his brother , Daniel [Crandall] , was the victim he had in mind when he returned from his sentence on the Outer Colonies . No reason was given . But we hope to get an interview with the brothers [Crandall] later on . That is if they 're still alive ! [door_whirs] I 'm sorry for what I tried to do just now . It 's been playing on my mind all these years . - Forget it . - But how can I ? First there was the thing between Polly and I . I always resented you , Nick . I always resented being second brother , second in everything . And taking Polly that evened up the score ? Put like that it sounds childish , but that 's a part of it . I told you earlier , Nick , how he fooled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be hearing many things . I believed you at the time ! - When you said you loved me . - Who are you kidding ? As far as you were concerned , it was a game . - One you enjoyed playing . - You killed the marriage between Nick and me . Stop lying to yourself ! You killed that yourself . It was in you . But you encouraged it to amuse yourself and kick back at him . Shut up ! Both of you ! It 's not important any more . I doubt if it ever was . I 've got more important things to think about . Yes , I suppose you have . If it is n't me you had in mind or Polly then that means ... But you ca n't go ahead with your original plan now . I can and I will . Not once you 've made a statement naming someone . The fact that I told a lie in a certain moment is only a minor infringement . - But , Nick , you 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Come to that , how can we be sure that it is n't one of us ? That you 're not playing a cat and mouse game . You 'll have to take my word for it . And supposing I do n't ? With what you 've stated , I could kill you any time now . Just to be sure and without any fear of getting into trouble . ln that case , I 'll tell you . I tell you who and why ! Look at that mess ! Record it while I trace them . Excuse me ! The brothers [Crandall] . Any idea where they are ? They went to his room , I think . Thanks . Come on . That 's the kind of [man] Stephensen turned out to be . Persuasive , friendly . I 'd been working for years on the theory of harnessing the power in Salturian Rocks . I needed a lab for the last stages , Stephensen obliged , then stole and registered the formula before I knew where I was . But I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract research with that friend of yours what was his a name Paul , Paul Ryman . Paul was assisting me . I suppose he lost on the deal too , but then he was an easy goer . It would n't have bothered him . To me it mattered . Wait a minute ! Have you seen him since you got back ? Yes . Just to say ' hello ' to -- Then if I were you I 'd talk some more with him . Considering his present wealth , I think you 'd find a talk very interesting . [doorbell_ringing] [door_whirs] Hello , Mr . [Crandall] and Mr . [Crandall] . Would either of you care to make a statement ? No , I would not . And I 'm going out . So I 'll leave you two to entertain each other . - Now , look . Mr . [Crandall] - Go ahead , Nick . You know something ? If you two could sort yourselves out , you 'd be great . ln a way you deserve each other . [door_whirs] Nick ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - To say ' hello ' properly and invite you to have a drink with me . Yesterday , well , I was n't very friendly . But I 'm sure you understand why . - What 'll it be ? - Nothing , thank you . Oh , come on . For old times ' sake . After all , it 's been a long time since you and I worked together . Yes . Anyway , I remember your tastes . A lot may have changed but I doubt if that has . creaking , [beeping] So here it is and here 's a welcome home . You said just now that I would understand about yesterday . Meaning that today is different . Why ? Simple . A short while ago I caught the journal flash . - About you and your brother . - And ? I ca n't say I was altogether surprised . We all knew what was going on those days between him and Polly . - Funny thing though . - What is ? I had an impression at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? - I did n't know . I had no idea . But what other reason could you have had for killing Dan ? None . None ! But it was stated . I told a lie to get him out of trouble . You mean that he was n't your target after all ? That 's right . Paul , I understand you 've been lucky . How do you mean ? That you 've become a wealthy [man] . Oh , I 've had a bit luck , yes . - It came out of blue . - What blue ? I do n't see that it 's any of your business . Well , maybe it is , maybe it is n't . You and I worked closely in the old days . You did a fine job , assisting me with my researches . Especially in that Salturian Rocks project . Well , now , I 'm just a little curious . I 'd like to know a bit more about that patch of blue you found . Some - - Some work I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name ? Would it have a name , like Stephensen , for example ? You - - You know ? Stephensen pulled the big trick . He got the rights to those researches . But it stands to reason he must have had some inside help . Nick , I 'm sorry but Stephensen offered me so much it made my mind boggle ! I just could n't keep my hands off it ! You should n't have trusted me the way you did . No [man] has the right to trust another [man] as much as that . Maybe I should n't have done it but the opportunity was there . I just could n't say ' no ' . Look , Nick , I 'll do anything ! Anything to make it up to you ! You-- You can have everything I 've got in the Token Bank . Nick , it 's a lot ! It 's an awful lot ! It can make up for so much ! Can it ? Can it make up for the understanding we once had ? Hmm ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand you . Look if it 's just revenge you want , if it 's my death , then go on kill me . Get it over with ! No . - Then what is it you want ? - Nothing . Except to know . To find out . To discover if truth , any kind of a truth , has a start or a finish . Well , you were n't away long . How did it go ? She 's dead . She 's been dead for two years ! Two whole years ! Elsa had me fooled all the time ! - She even played the last card ! - I do n't understand ? She was your wife , why did n't they tell you -- Because she divorced me ! She got a special annulment and married someone else . I went to her new address . This [man] answered the door . Introduced himself , then told me Elsa died in an accident . The [man] was upset when he told me . And do you want to know something , Nick ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had a happy marriage together ! [indistinct_chatter] Otto maybe it 's just as well . What do you mean ? Seven years of my life gone for nothing . Now , no future , nothing to show for it . Not even the satisfaction . - It 's different for you . - Is it ? I 've spent the last seven years , hating one [man] wanting revenge . Only to find that others the ones I loved and trusted meant no more to me in my life than Stephensen . Otto , I do n't know what it 's about any more . I do n't know what love and hate mean . I only know that I 'm tired and all that effort , trying to keep alive on the colonies . I 'm beginning to think that there was no point in it . No point at all . Mr . [Crandall] . I 'll be back , Otto . - Miss Bell ? - Hello . Mr . Stephensen will be back earlier than expected . He 'll be in the office at eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know certain things . Enough to know that my name is [Crandall] and that I have had a plan in mind . Now add that to the fact that I 've been trying to meet Stephensen . I know , Mr . [Crandall] . I fully realise . But earlier you were talking as though you were grateful to him . Only in one sense . ln that he allowed me to work alongside him . It was only a compensation . You see he was going to marry me . Only he changed his mind at the last moment and married someone else . I once tried to pluck up courage to confess to the pre-criminal Court myself ... To go through what you 've been through . But I could n't face it . Now , through you , I can still hit back at him . - How what plans have you made ? - The method ? None . Not exactly . It can kill at any range . I 'll be watching the journals all evening , Mr . [Crandall] . The best of luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otto [Henck] . Hello . Otto [Henck] here . [man_over_visu-phone] Mr . [Henck] , I have a proposal . One I think you will find interesting . What 's that ? Listen carefully and I 'll tell you . Mr [Crandall] may I speak to you ? It 's a free universe . What I have to say is most important ! Permit me to introduce myself . Ballaskia is my name . Edward Ballaskia . You 're not a media [man] , are you ? From one of those journal companies -- - No . - Then that 's all right . Please sit down , Mr . [Crandall] . What I have to tell you , is that what you contemplate doing is morally wrong . - Perhaps . - But let me assure you it is ! I can only implore with you to forgive your enemies to turn your other cheek ! Are you a religionist ? I am asking you to remember hope , faith and charity ! And the greatest of those is charity ! ln other words , sir , open your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understand the weakness which caused them to give you offence and forgive them ! Maybe I 'd like to . Perhaps you can give me a good reason why . Because it is spiritually right ! It is ethically right ! And for you , it can be profitably right ! - I do n't understand . - Think of it ! Think what it can mean , if you can say so yourself , that you have suffered seven , long miserable years all for a purpose that we all know about and then , in the final moment , you rise above your base instincts and forgive and forget ! - Maybe you 're right ! - And revenge ... Cheap , emotional revenge like that is so unrewarding ! Especially when it can be replaced with an offer that I have in mind . I mentioned just now , if you were to change your course , alter your direction , realign your purpose , it could be made profitably right for you ! - So you did . - Mr . [Crandall] , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now it so happens that I want one murder committed . You 're mad . I am wealthy . You I judge , and please do n't take offence sir , you are not well off . I can make you comfortable for the rest of your life . Extremely comfortable . So put aside your thoughts , your cheap , unworthy thoughts of anger and personal revenge . You see , I have a business associate who has been -- To hell with you ! Go and serve your own seven years ! Do we understand one another , Mr . [Henck] ? I think so . Well ? Yes or no ? I 'll think it over . I 'll call you back . Otto , I 'm going to meet Stephensen . I thought you 'd changed your mind . Well , he 's due back earlier than expected . Wish me luck . [door_whirs] Hello , [Crandall] . Sorry to keep you waiting . - That 's all right , it 's only a day . ln one sense , it does n't make all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ? Or even seven , come to that ? It 's all according to the way one looks at it . You seem sure of yourself . Why should n't I be ? Quietly , firmly , I 've always known that it was me you had in mind from the day you went away . Knowing , without any doubts , without any guessing , stopped me worrying about it . Then I take it you think you have an answer for me ? Of course ! I would n't be the [man] I am if I could n't think something like that through . I see . I said just now that this extra day , in one sense , has n't made any difference . - But in another sense it has . - What do you mean ? - I 've changed my mind . - You 've done what ? I 've lived with the one thought for so long that of killing you . But you were by no means the only one to double cross me , to take advantage of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sense , a purpose . - While the others -- - That 's all very interesting . For my peace of mind , I wish I could believe what you say . The only thing now is , and oddly enough , you might tell me this . Since I 've lived on hate , fed on it , what do I put in its place ? I do n't think that 'll be any problem . I said I 'd give you an answer and I have . He 's standing behind you . That 's right , Nick . I 'm up here . Otto ! My Stephensen made me a proposition . One that makes sense of those seven years that I lost . Especially in view of the way you feel . So , Nick , there 's no more choice for you and none for me . lasering , explosion I wonder if he really meant what he said . - He did . - Then why did you kill him ? I was his last friend . It was my turn to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the five million credits will be deposited in your account tomorrow morning . Thank you , sir . \\r\\n\"]"

[computer_whirring] Come on . Let's check the prisoners . Your attention and look this way ! ln a few minutes , we'll be making an Earth entry . ln ten , you'll be getting out of your bunks and moving through the Liberty Corridor . Now , you've all been good boys so far . We've had a nice trip . But until you get your discharge papers , let me remind you of one thing ... You are still convicts ! Which means that we don't want any trouble in our last minutes together . I want no demonstrations , no cracks about the Interstellar Prison Service once we've landed , no sneaky tricks of any kind . Because if you've got anything like that in mind , there's me , there's my friend and there are these prods . Most of you have had a tickle or two from them . So you know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . Now , let's check your restrainers . Think of it . In a couple of hours you'll all be free . Back on Mother Earth , eating normal food sleeping in normal beds . Maybe sleeping with someone . Just doing what you like , when you like . And that's something our prize specimens , our pre-criminals , will be looking forward to . Isn't that so , [Crandall] ? Prisoner [Crandall] . I spoke to you . I want an answer . What was the question , sir ? I said are you looking forward to your big event or aren't you ? - Yes . I am . - Thanks for replying . You pre-criminals are all the same , those of you who get to make the trip back . You have a look about you , a special look that says that you're a law unto yourselves . But let me tell you something , as far as I'm concerned , you're not ! And with one swipe of this prod I can wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered , you 'd be taking a chance , wouldn't you ? No , [Crandall] , I don't think so . You might grind your teeth , but when it comes to it I don't think you 'd waste your special , precious licence that you've qualified for on me . Maybe not . But all the same , don't push so hard . Is your friend going to speak about the big event ? You gave him a tickle yesterday or had you forgotten ? So I did . But the paralysis should wear off soon . When it does , you can tell him that he can look forward to the big event then it's his turn for fun , too . I will . But it's no thanks to you . Better strap in . We'll be hitting the entry shocks soon . [whirring] Otto ! Otto ! Come on , it's nearly time ! [Henck] here , sir ! pre-criminal 525514 . Oh , Nick . What's up ? We're nearly home ! The ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! - How do you feel ? Sick , dizzy . The way one always feels after a touch of one of those guys ' prods . Nerves twisting about . Forget it . We're nearly through with him . And then I was dreaming . I was dreaming when you must have touched me . About Elsa . A new way to get her . A brand new , really ugly way . Easy . Think of other things for the moment . Like food , drink , relaxation . The way I figure it , that comes later . First it's Elsa . That can't be . Not just like that . We've been away seven years . Things will have changed . First we have to adjust . What's wrong with you Nick ? Have you turned soft ? Don't tell me you've forgotten about him ? No . I haven't . But it's been a long wait . A short while longer isn't going to make all that difference . I suppose not . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Otherwise what would the last seven years have meant ? [man_over_PA] Orbital count down . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . [loud_whirring] [high_pitched_noise] [engines_roaring] Here we go Otto . Into the home stretch . Closer to your Elsa and my Stephensen ! [rumbling] [overlapping_chatter] We won't have long to wait for our story . pre-criminals just once in a decade that get back to Earth . Which ones are [Crandall] and [Henck] ? Wait and see . Gomez , Stephens , prisoners Class C , go to number four desk , on the right along the corridor , for your clearance and discharge . @electronic_whirring , [bleeping] Arthur and Garfinkel , prisoners class B , go to number two desk , on the left . @electronic_whirring , [bleeping] Reeves and Nation , prisoners class A , go to number three desk , on the right . @electronic_whirring , [bleeping] [Crandall] and [Henck] . pre-criminals . Go to number one desk over there . @electronic_whirring , [bleeping] [Crandall] , [Henck] , we 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them through . They haven't been discharged yet . How does it feel to be back ? I guess a few words won't hurt . I asked , what's it like to be back on Earth ? Fine , just fine . What's the first thing you're going to do once you get your discharge ? - Eat a good meal . - And then ? Drink maybe . New clothes . And relax . Yes . But after that ? Tell us , would you care to name any names ? No . No comment . Well , that's your privilege . Yes that's their privilege . Now report to number one desk , the examiner is waiting . Name and detail ? Nicholas [Crandall] , number 525509 . Research engineer , advanced chemist , mechanical theorist . Correct ? Yes , sir . And now that you have served your pre-sentence , do you still want your special licence ? Yes . I do . Married then divorced . No children . Perhaps the reason for your wanting it lies there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right under the Pre-Criminal Code . Yes , sir . And you ? You must be Otto [Henck] , number 525514 ? Yes , sir . Sea farmer , married , no children . And you , [Henck] , do you still want your licence ? Yes , sir . Then let's look at the records . Both of you appeared before the authorities seven years ago and made confessions of intent . You were sentenced and served your sentences in the outer galaxies . - Yes , sir . - Where , exactly ? Two years on Rigel 12 , another two on Antares 8 and the final three on Proxima Centaurus . It's unusual for men to spend such long times on those planets and then return . How do you account for the fact that you both managed to survive such an ordeal ? Luck sir , and the fact that we were there together . When I was attacked by molten lava on Rigel 12 , Otto [Henck] saved me and then looked after me . Which is no more than he did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill me . So you looked after one another , served out a rough comradeship in order to survive and to qualify for the right to hold these licences ? Yes , sir . The Pre-criminal Code guarantees that you will get them . You've served sentences equivalent to half of that which you would have received , had you committed the crime under the Normal Penal Code . But what does it achieve ? Many would-be criminals have had time to pause and reflect and then changed their minds . The result , crime incidence has been greatly reduced . That's all very well , but what about their intended victims ? After all , Examiner , it could be you it could be me . That's a risk we have to take for a progressive law . But what's wrong with punishment as a straight line deterrent ? Imprisonment , whippings , executions , they were effective . If you think so and want to return to the Dark Years , you have only to take a trip back in the time machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Then keep quiet . Nicholas [Crandall] and Otto [Henck] , having regard to the work that you have achieved in helping to colonise those places in which you've spent the last seven years , I accordingly grant you your complete discharge and your legal licences to go forth from this place and kill one [man] or one woman of your own choosing ! [cameral_clicks] How do you feel now , Mr . [Crandall] ? Mr . [Henck] ? Now that you've got these licences ? I'm not sure . Except maybe to hope . Hope ? Hope what ? That our victims are in good health , and waiting for us . **32;5900;TOOLONG [reporter] Can we have a personal interview for our newspaper ? Well , we're in luck . There are several rooms vacant according to this indicator . Why pick this place , Nick ? It's expensive . Look at those rates . Twelve credits a day . We can afford it . But I've only got about a hundred credits all told in my token account . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend it to you . Come on let's register ! clicking , [beeping] Right . Your turn . clicking , [beeping] The Capricorn Ritz ! I never thought I 'd be staying here . Let's go to the bar and get ourselves that drink . Should we ? I mean all these people -- They're minding their own business . So come on . - I just thought -- - I know . But if we want to re-join the human race , we've got to make an effort . And a drink will help , so come on . [man_on_TV] And since the authority introduced the new tourist service on the planet , Mars , 50,000 people have taken advantage ... Well , I told you things would've changed . Before we went away a barman used to serve the drinks . Now they've automated him out of business . Then what do we do ? Take one and sign for it by pressing here I suppose . [beeping] , [whirring] Our signal is transmitted to a Token Bank and we get deducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all ... Too easy . This could mean ruin for me in no time . Besides , what do you do for company when you're by yourself ? Visu-check . Always on tap . I told you things would've changed since they sent us away . All these new things . [man_continues_on_TV] The extra thrust of the spaceship , the transporter , even this mechanical bar working day and night everywhere , and every one of them motivated by the new power source . [man_on_TV] ... has now successfully been brought back to life . Stephensen Power . Stephensen . He must be the richest [man] alive . Just about . And to think it's your name that should have been on that marker . No wonder you feel about him the way you do . Just for the moment , let's forget him . Instead , here's to us . - Across the stars . - [on_TV] Back here on Earth , the convict spaceship Jean Valjean landed earlier today and discharged two pre-criminals , Nicholas [Crandall] and Otto [Henck] . Two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licences to commit one murder apiece . Take a good look at them , it might be you they're after ! I suppose that had to happen . [man_on_TV] A fire is reported to be raging ... Come on , let's take these drinks over there . Away from all these people . ... believe that the fire extends for 1,000 square miles ... That means everyone will be on the alert . Everyone will be watching out for us . Including our targets . As far as I am concerned , it doesn't make any difference . Elsa knows ! I told her that day , just before I turned myself in . She knows I wouldn't take a murder rap for anyone but her ! Then you wore a fool ! That means she'll be armed , ready to defend herself . It won't make any difference . I'll get her just the same . And , what's more , I told her on purpose . I want her to know . I wanted her to wait and squirm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick . I bet she's had hers too . Which serves her right for the 12 years of so called marriage that she gave me before that . Using me , playing around , laughing at me . - That was a real hell , Nick . - I know . But don't get clouded up so you can't think straight . Don't worry . When it comes to the moment I won't mess it up , not after all that . It's different for you , Nick . A [man] may have cheated you out of what should have been yours , but at least your wife didn't mess you up in a way that only a woman can . That's true . My marriage was good while it lasted . Five years and then we just seemed to drift apart . - But without any real hurt . - Your wife gave you a divorce . She didn't insist on hanging on to make you suffer . Polly was all right . A bit mixed up maybe , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all there , the next it wasn't . But I've always remembered her nicely . No bad feelings there . Only for Stephensen and what he cheated me out of . Well , I'll be darned ! Someone I know ! Paul , how are you ? Well , of all people to meet on my first day back . - How - - How are you ? - All right . Strange . I hadn't expected to meet any old friends so soon . And then you and I , all those years we spent in research together . - That was a long time ago . - Seven or eight years . Well , what have you been doing in the meantime ? What are you doing now ? I'm all right . I keep busy . I'm - - I'm in business . Good . I hope it's going well . Look , I'm with a friend so why not join us for a drink ? No thanks , as a matter of fact , I'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see them coming now . Hi . - So , you see ? - Yes , I see . - You saw ... - If you'll excuse me . - What's up ? - Nothing . I thought I saw an old friend . ln point of fact , what I saw was an ex-friend . You and I are going to have plenty of those from how on . [laughter] Come on , let's get out of here it's like being in a glass bowl . That's just what I was thinking and Nick , I'm getting restless . I want to do something about finding Elsa right away . Yes , and I should be looking after my one too . I'll try the apartment . Elsa should be there at this time . Yes , and I'll call on Stephensen at the lab . That's the most likely place . - See you back here later . - Yeah , right . - And , Otto - Yes ? - Good luck , huh ? - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It's in position now . Temperature reading , 5,500 over 25 . Wait five seconds for reduction to normal , then close and activate . Five , four , three , two , one . cracking , whooshing That batch should keep up our quota . Give me an exact reading on the results later . I'm looking for Stephensen . My name is Marshall . Roger Marshall . I'm sorry , he's away at the moment . But I'm [Marie] Bell , his chief assistant . - Away ? - On vacation . At his hunting lodge in Central Tibet . Oh . But if it's business in connection with the lab , I can speak on his behalf . When do you expect him back ? I'm not sure . He's liable to drop in at any moment . On the other hand , it could take a few days . Well , you see , I have some information I'm sure would interest him . - Yes ? - I'm a research developer . I've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of your power system . I have completed an advance which will increase the value of the power source considerably . Well , in that case , I'm sure he 'd be interested . If you care to leave the details with me -- No , no , thank you . Thank you all the same but I think I 'd rather speak to him personally . As you wish . Is this the first time you've seen the laboratory ? Yes . I did see it some time ago when it was in a different form . An idea on paper . The original plans ? Then that means that you've met Mr . Stephensen before ? Yes . Way back . He wouldn't remember me . All the same that means you must have an idea of - what is being done here . - Yes , a fair idea . That tank there , that's the main storage unit where the Salturian Rocks are kept when they're brought to Earth . From there we take them and place them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stephensen Theory and the result is power that leaves through the Source Conduit at the far end . - Of course , we -- - The Stephensen Theory ? Yes . His famous theory . The one he perfected eight years ago . Of course . These laboratories are established everywhere now - on Venus on the Moon , on Mars . - On practically every colony . They provide 97 per cent of all the power used - in the Solar System . - Very impressive . For someone who walks in here and talks of an advance , you seem uncertain of what is generally known by everyone . Well , you see , I've been working in isolation . The only way that a research developer , like myself , can arrive at abstracts which is my main field . I see . All the same , I'm sure that Mr . Stephensen will be pleased to hear what I have to say . He's always willing to listen to new ideas . Yes , I've no doubt . You must derive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place like this . - Yes . I was lucky to be allowed to work at all . Most graduates from my seminar passed straight into the Leisure Group . It must be terrible not to be able to contribute as long as you live . How did you get started here ? Mr . Stephensen took an interest in me . - He's been very kind . - I see . When he gets back , perhaps you would inform me . I can be contacted at the Capricorn Ritz room 412 . - 412 . Right . - Thank you . [door_whirs] [radio_sounds] Yes ? [man] Floor here . The batch is ready . Thank you . [door_whirs] At two credits a glass , how are you making out ? Hello . Not so bad . It's only my third all evening . Or fourth , I don't remember exactly . How did It go , with Elsa I mean . She wasn't there . Not even the apartment . The whole district has been redeveloped . - There wasn't sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you where she's gone ? I was so shocked I didn't know what to do . That whole district was nothing but 80 tier apartment blocks as far as the eye could see . Now it's nothing but a huge nature park . - But surely -- - The last thing I expected . I just stood in the middle of the park not knowing what to do . But even if she has moved on , there must be a record ? You don't understand , Nick . All that time we were away , all the while , I kept thinking of how it was going to be when I finally caught up with her , the times I dreamed of it . And it always happened in that place . Now it just isn't there anymore . I'm sorry , Nick . I was just thinking about my side of it . - How did it go with him ? - Same story , he was away . Oh . You want to have a drink ? No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I'll go up to my room get some rest . - Sure . - See you in the morning , Otto . - You should get some rest too . - I will . Nick , don't worry . It won't make any difference . I'll look for Elsa , I'll find her - and when I do -- - I know . Good night , Otto . Good night . [door_buzzes] [soft_electronic_whirring] [bleep] **27;5934;TOOLONG , quietly [spraying] [intercom_crackles] - Yes ? - Good evening , Mr . [Crandall] . I hope I'm not disturbing you . - Who are you ? - Henson Marcus Henson of the Main Continent Media Exchange . I was at the space-port earlier today . What can I do for you , Mr . Henson ? My company is interested in your story . Very interested . Mr . Henson . I'm tired . I've had a long day -- And the public is excited by it . They've been lapping up the details ever since you landed . Perhaps you've seen our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about it ? We 'd like to follow it up get an exclusive interview from you . Not interested , I've had a taste of being a freak . - I don't want to cultivate it . - Don't be hasty Mr . [Crandall] . You haven't heard our proposition yet . What proposition ? Fifty thousand credits payable to your account in the Token Bank . Fifty thousand ! That's right . Fifty thousand for you just to tell us your story . The full story . Well , you know most of it already . I mean everything that happened to us . We want to know everything . From the moment you first went to the authorities and confessed to your pre-criminal intention . Every experience that you underwent in those terrible places you were sent to . Oh , I know you mentioned some at the spaceport but I had the feeling earlier that you were playing down some of the incidents . I answered the questions straight . I know . But we want the inside story . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to your hand ? - My hand ? - Yes . You're wearing that surgical glove . Did you lose your hand ? And if so , how ? You see , it's details like this the public wants to know about . But the biggest thing they want to know about , and that's why we're prepared to pay so much , is that special piece of information that clinches your story . - I don't understand . - Oh , come on now ! What do you think they're all excited about ? What do you think they're really guessing at ? You know as well as I . They're trying to figure out who your victim is going to be ! You tell us , we'll follow your story , we'll be there when it happens and you can retire a rich [man] while at the same time completing what you set out to do ! Mr . Henson , I have no intention of -- I know the code says you don't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there's nothing to stop you changing your mind and profiting by it . And the chances will still be on your side . Henson you're wasting your time ! - Now if you'll excuse me -- - Now , look , Mr . [Crandall] -- Good night , Mr . Henson . [music_begins_again] [Crandall] , inflashback Let's get this rock out of the way , Otto . [Henck] All right . [Crandall] Get your shoulder behind it . [Crandall] Push from the other side . [Henck] That's what I'm doing . [Henck] It's starting to go ! It's moving ! [Crandall] Just a little more effort ! [Henck] There it goes ! But look out . Nick ! The lava ! Watch it ! It'll strike ! [screaming] [Henck] Nick , what happened ? - It , it got my hand ! - [Henck] Let me see ! [Henck] , echoing What hand , Nick ? What hand ? [bell_chiming] [buzzer] Polly ! You're that last person I expected to see . - Is that true ? - Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ex-husbands up . Nick , please don't play games with me . - Hmm ? - Don't be that cruel ! I know why you served your sentence . The moment I saw you presented on the journal casts last night . - I knew why you did it . - Polly , I don't know - what you're talking about . - Yes , you do . You knew all along . I felt it . I suppose you tell me . When we were married there was only one [man] ever ! One [man] what ? Only one that I was unfaithful with ! And I made a mistake . I thought he loved me . I would never have divorced you if I 'd known what he was really like . A first class mistake . The biggest I ever made . And because of that I've been punished enough . So , please Nick ! Please don't kill me ! Well , we live and learn . Nick , it was over nine years ago , eight at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @n't make any sense . No , you're right , it wouldn't . Please don't take your revenge after all this time . Don't worry , Polly . I won't . The way things happened between him and me , well , you know , the way he talks . You won't ? You won't kill me after all ? Polly you're talking about something I know nothing about . And never did . - You didn't ? - I never realised . But I could have sworn , when I asked for divorce ... I thought it was for the reasons you gave at the time . That you just wanted to be free . Then then you wouldn't even know who he was ? No , and after all this time perhaps it's better that I don't . Are you telling me the truth ? Or are you playing with me wanting me to suffer some more ? That's the truth , Polly . After that , I could do with a drink . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual ? Yes . [whirring] I really did think you knew all along . [beeping] No . I trusted you . It only started because you insisted on working . When you became involved with that scheme . I had time left over . Time outside the Organised Leisure Programme . I had time in which to become bored . You should have told me . You wouldn't have listened . You were so involved . My researches meant a lot to me . I would've thought they 'd meant a lot to us . I know . But in the end whatever happened to them ? Come to that what happened to me ? - What do you mean ? - I loved you . Despite what I have just told you , I did love you . I made a mistake in asking for that divorce . And I have regretted it ever since . How are things with you otherwise ? All right . I live in North America , near the Great Lakes . Got a nice apartment . As you gather I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time away ? It wasn't a picnic . - My mother died . Last year . - I'm sorry to hear that . She elected of her own accord . She was feeling bored and the authority issued a voluntary pill . - I see . And your father ? - He's fine . He still potters with his hobby . You know cultivating those Martian Blooms . Nick , I was wondering . - Couldn't we ? - Oh , Polly ! Couldn't we start over again just forget everything ? It's too late . Much too late to pick up . It wouldn't work , and besides ... I know . You have only come back to complete one thing . Yes . Nick , I didn't ask ... I purposely didn't ask but if it isn't me you're after , then who is it ? [bleeping] Yes ? [man_over_radio] Mr . Stephensen calling you from Tibet , Miss Bell . Go ahead , Mr . Stephensen . - [Marie] , how are you ? - Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Excellent . - What about things at the lab ? - Normal . Production is steady . We've got plenty of reserve . Good . - When will you be back ? - Later today . - Yes , but what time ? - At ten o'clock this evening . Good . - We look forward to seeing you . - Why ? A [man] called in last evening . He has a very good research idea , which I'm sure will interest you . I see . Then make an appointment . Thank you . - Goodbye , [Marie] . - Bye . Have a good trip back . Yes , Miss Bell ? Get me the Capricorn-Ritz Hotel , please . [man_over_PA] 4 12 to visu-phone ... Calling 4 12 . Excuse me . Yes ? [Marie] Mr . [Crandall] ? I've heard from Mr . Stephensen . He'll be back at 10:00 . I've made an appointment for you . You will be there , won't you ? Yes , I will . Thank you . Will you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'll make out . I know you will , Nick . Good bye . - My wife . I mean my ex . - Oh ? She just came to say hello . Then wound up asking me who I had in mind . - You didn't tell her ? - What do you think ? How did it go with you ? First thing this morning I contacted the Movement Bureau . They gave me Elsa's new address . - Good . - I'm going there now . - See you later . - Sure . creaking , [beeping] Nick ! lasering , explosion Look up there on the gantry ! coughing , spluttering Find him . Here he is ! This is the [man] who fired . Daniel ! - Do you know him ? - He's my brother ! All right let's hear it . What's the commotion about ? But I don't understand . Why , Dan ? Simple , Nick . I had to get you first - But , Dan - Wait a minute ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was released yesterday ? I see . Get the blaster . I saw it all . I was up there when he aimed . Maybe you shouldn't have interfered . It could be entirely their own business . Now , look , I'm going to have to take statements from you both . You both know the basic law in a situation like this . So let's get started . Why , Dan ? What was it all about ? - You know . You've always known . - Dan ! I tried to reach you to tell you that there was no need . - I see . - But I don't . As I said before , you know the position in law . [Crandall] , you were a pre-criminal . You have a special licence . He fired at you . Now , if it can be proved that he had reasonable cause to believe that he was your intended victim , then he had every right to anticipate you . But if not , then he would be guilty of attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Outer Colonies . So , Mr . [Crandall] , it's up to you . What do you have to say ? Was your brother your intended victim or not ? Well ? - Yes . Yes it was him . - You're sure ? - That lady that came in -- - Yes , I'm quite sure ! All right you heard what he had to say . You can let him go . He's free . Whichever way they work it out from now on that's their business . Or forget it and disperse . And it's none of ours . So let's leave ! Thanks , Otto . I didn't have time to think about it . It happened I moved . If you're okay now , I'll check on Elsa . Yes . I'm all right . Polly tells me that you were lying just now . That you did so to save me from a spell on the colonies . That you never had any idea about us . No idea at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash from the Capricorn Ritz Hotel in Sahara City where , a few moments ago , an unsuccessful attempt was made on the life of the ex-pre-criminal Nicholas [Crandall] . Look , we can't talk here . [Crandall] stated later that his brother , Daniel [Crandall] , was the victim he had in mind when he returned from his sentence on the Outer Colonies . No reason was given . But we hope to get an interview with the brothers [Crandall] later on . That is if they're still alive ! [door_whirs] I'm sorry for what I tried to do just now . It's been playing on my mind all these years . - Forget it . - But how can I ? First there was the thing between Polly and I . I always resented you , Nick . I always resented being second brother , second in everything . And taking Polly that evened up the score ? Put like that it sounds childish , but that's a part of it . I told you earlier , Nick , how he fooled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be hearing many things . I believed you at the time ! - When you said you loved me . - Who are you kidding ? As far as you were concerned , it was a game . - One you enjoyed playing . - You killed the marriage between Nick and me . Stop lying to yourself ! You killed that yourself . It was in you . But you encouraged it to amuse yourself and kick back at him . Shut up ! Both of you ! It's not important any more . I doubt if it ever was . I've got more important things to think about . Yes , I suppose you have . If it isn't me you had in mind or Polly then that means ... But you can't go ahead with your original plan now . I can and I will . Not once you've made a statement naming someone . The fact that I told a lie in a certain moment is only a minor infringement . - But , Nick , you 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Come to that , how can we be sure that it isn't one of us ? That you're not playing a cat and mouse game . You'll have to take my word for it . And supposing I don't ? With what you've stated , I could kill you any time now . Just to be sure and without any fear of getting into trouble . ln that case , I'll tell you . I tell you who and why ! Look at that mess ! Record it while I trace them . Excuse me ! The brothers [Crandall] . Any idea where they are ? They went to his room , I think . Thanks . Come on . That's the kind of [man] Stephensen turned out to be . Persuasive , friendly . I 'd been working for years on the theory of harnessing the power in Salturian Rocks . I needed a lab for the last stages , Stephensen obliged , then stole and registered the formula before I knew where I was . But I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract research with that friend of yours what was his a name Paul , Paul Ryman . Paul was assisting me . I suppose he lost on the deal too , but then he was an easy goer . It wouldn't have bothered him . To me it mattered . Wait a minute ! Have you seen him since you got back ? Yes . Just to say ' hello ' to -- Then if I were you I 'd talk some more with him . Considering his present wealth , I think you 'd find a talk very interesting . [doorbell_ringing] [door_whirs] Hello , Mr . [Crandall] and Mr . [Crandall] . Would either of you care to make a statement ? No , I would not . And I'm going out . So I'll leave you two to entertain each other . - Now , look . Mr . [Crandall] - Go ahead , Nick . You know something ? If you two could sort yourselves out , you 'd be great . ln a way you deserve each other . [door_whirs] Nick ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - To say ' hello ' properly and invite you to have a drink with me . Yesterday , well , I wasn't very friendly . But I'm sure you understand why . - What'll it be ? - Nothing , thank you . Oh , come on . For old times ' sake . After all , it's been a long time since you and I worked together . Yes . Anyway , I remember your tastes . A lot may have changed but I doubt if that has . creaking , [beeping] So here it is and here's a welcome home . You said just now that I would understand about yesterday . Meaning that today is different . Why ? Simple . A short while ago I caught the journal flash . - About you and your brother . - And ? I can't say I was altogether surprised . We all knew what was going on those days between him and Polly . - Funny thing though . - What is ? I had an impression at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? - I didn't know . I had no idea . But what other reason could you have had for killing Dan ? None . None ! But it was stated . I told a lie to get him out of trouble . You mean that he wasn't your target after all ? That's right . Paul , I understand you've been lucky . How do you mean ? That you've become a wealthy [man] . Oh , I've had a bit luck , yes . - It came out of blue . - What blue ? I don't see that it's any of your business . Well , maybe it is , maybe it isn't . You and I worked closely in the old days . You did a fine job , assisting me with my researches . Especially in that Salturian Rocks project . Well , now , I'm just a little curious . I 'd like to know a bit more about that patch of blue you found . Some - - Some work I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name ? Would it have a name , like Stephensen , for example ? You - - You know ? Stephensen pulled the big trick . He got the rights to those researches . But it stands to reason he must have had some inside help . Nick , I'm sorry but Stephensen offered me so much it made my mind boggle ! I just couldn't keep my hands off it ! You shouldn't have trusted me the way you did . No [man] has the right to trust another [man] as much as that . Maybe I shouldn't have done it but the opportunity was there . I just couldn't say ' no ' . Look , Nick , I'll do anything ! Anything to make it up to you ! You-- You can have everything I've got in the Token Bank . Nick , it's a lot ! It's an awful lot ! It can make up for so much ! Can it ? Can it make up for the understanding we once had ? Hmm ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand you . Look if it's just revenge you want , if it's my death , then go on kill me . Get it over with ! No . - Then what is it you want ? - Nothing . Except to know . To find out . To discover if truth , any kind of a truth , has a start or a finish . Well , you weren't away long . How did it go ? She's dead . She's been dead for two years ! Two whole years ! Elsa had me fooled all the time ! - She even played the last card ! - I don't understand ? She was your wife , why didn't they tell you -- Because she divorced me ! She got a special annulment and married someone else . I went to her new address . This [man] answered the door . Introduced himself , then told me Elsa died in an accident . The [man] was upset when he told me . And do you want to know something , Nick ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had a happy marriage together ! [indistinct_chatter] Otto maybe it's just as well . What do you mean ? Seven years of my life gone for nothing . Now , no future , nothing to show for it . Not even the satisfaction . - It's different for you . - Is it ? I've spent the last seven years , hating one [man] wanting revenge . Only to find that others the ones I loved and trusted meant no more to me in my life than Stephensen . Otto , I don't know what it's about any more . I don't know what love and hate mean . I only know that I'm tired and all that effort , trying to keep alive on the colonies . I'm beginning to think that there was no point in it . No point at all . Mr . [Crandall] . I'll be back , Otto . - Miss Bell ? - Hello . Mr . Stephensen will be back earlier than expected . He'll be in the office at eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know certain things . Enough to know that my name is [Crandall] and that I have had a plan in mind . Now add that to the fact that I've been trying to meet Stephensen . I know , Mr . [Crandall] . I fully realise . But earlier you were talking as though you were grateful to him . Only in one sense . ln that he allowed me to work alongside him . It was only a compensation . You see he was going to marry me . Only he changed his mind at the last moment and married someone else . I once tried to pluck up courage to confess to the pre-criminal Court myself ... To go through what you've been through . But I couldn't face it . Now , through you , I can still hit back at him . - How what plans have you made ? - The method ? None . Not exactly . It can kill at any range . I'll be watching the journals all evening , Mr . [Crandall] . The best of luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otto [Henck] . Hello . Otto [Henck] here . [man_over_visu-phone] Mr . [Henck] , I have a proposal . One I think you will find interesting . What's that ? Listen carefully and I'll tell you . Mr [Crandall] may I speak to you ? It's a free universe . What I have to say is most important ! Permit me to introduce myself . Ballaskia is my name . Edward Ballaskia . You're not a media [man] , are you ? From one of those journal companies -- - No . - Then that's all right . Please sit down , Mr . [Crandall] . What I have to tell you , is that what you contemplate doing is morally wrong . - Perhaps . - But let me assure you it is ! I can only implore with you to forgive your enemies to turn your other cheek ! Are you a religionist ? I am asking you to remember hope , faith and charity ! And the greatest of those is charity ! ln other words , sir , open your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understand the weakness which caused them to give you offence and forgive them ! Maybe I 'd like to . Perhaps you can give me a good reason why . Because it is spiritually right ! It is ethically right ! And for you , it can be profitably right ! - I don't understand . - Think of it ! Think what it can mean , if you can say so yourself , that you have suffered seven , long miserable years all for a purpose that we all know about and then , in the final moment , you rise above your base instincts and forgive and forget ! - Maybe you're right ! - And revenge ... Cheap , emotional revenge like that is so unrewarding ! Especially when it can be replaced with an offer that I have in mind . I mentioned just now , if you were to change your course , alter your direction , realign your purpose , it could be made profitably right for you ! - So you did . - Mr . [Crandall] , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now it so happens that I want one murder committed . You're mad . I am wealthy . You I judge , and please don't take offence sir , you are not well off . I can make you comfortable for the rest of your life . Extremely comfortable . So put aside your thoughts , your cheap , unworthy thoughts of anger and personal revenge . You see , I have a business associate who has been -- To hell with you ! Go and serve your own seven years ! Do we understand one another , Mr . [Henck] ? I think so . Well ? Yes or no ? I'll think it over . I'll call you back . Otto , I'm going to meet Stephensen . I thought you 'd changed your mind . Well , he's due back earlier than expected . Wish me luck . [door_whirs] Hello , [Crandall] . Sorry to keep you waiting . - That's all right , it's only a day . ln one sense , it doesn't make all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ? Or even seven , come to that ? It's all according to the way one looks at it . You seem sure of yourself . Why shouldn't I be ? Quietly , firmly , I've always known that it was me you had in mind from the day you went away . Knowing , without any doubts , without any guessing , stopped me worrying about it . Then I take it you think you have an answer for me ? Of course ! I wouldn't be the [man] I am if I couldn't think something like that through . I see . I said just now that this extra day , in one sense , hasn't made any difference . - But in another sense it has . - What do you mean ? - I've changed my mind . - You've done what ? I've lived with the one thought for so long that of killing you . But you were by no means the only one to double cross me , to take advantage of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sense , a purpose . - While the others -- - That's all very interesting . For my peace of mind , I wish I could believe what you say . The only thing now is , and oddly enough , you might tell me this . Since I've lived on hate , fed on it , what do I put in its place ? I don't think that'll be any problem . I said I 'd give you an answer and I have . He's standing behind you . That's right , Nick . I'm up here . Otto ! My Stephensen made me a proposition . One that makes sense of those seven years that I lost . Especially in view of the way you feel . So , Nick , there's no more choice for you and none for me . lasering , explosion I wonder if he really meant what he said . - He did . - Then why did you kill him ? I was his last friend . It was my turn to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the five million credits will be deposited in your account tomorrow morning . Thank you , sir . \\r\\n\"]"

    "# Week 2 - Counting Words & Phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words, simple and parsed phrases and explore the statistical properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and phrases across a corpus, and the correlation between different words and phrase counts. In order to do this effectively, we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and lemmatization. Next we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! Then we calculate word frequenceis, conditional frequences (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of lengths 2 through $n$. Finally, we calculate and visualize Differences (Divergences and Distances) between the word frequency distributions from two corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we shift to focus not simply on the *ideas* in a corpus, but also extracting precise *claims*. This process involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting informational claims from those phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be introducing spaCy as a package for Computational Linguistics, and also walk you through how to use the Davies Corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we wish to avoid using NLTK for heavy corpus analysis, some of its smaller functions can still be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we will be using the following packages:\n"

    "This shows that likelihood of a word occurring is inversely proportional to its rank. This effect is called [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), and suggests that the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. Zipf's law is most easily observed by plotting the data on a log-log graph, with the axes being log (rank order) and log (frequency) resulting in a linear relationship."

      "SEN. WHITEHOUSE SHARES WESTERLY GIRL'S STORY IN PUSH FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH\n",
      "  Sharing the story of Lila Barber, a 12 year old girl from Westerly, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday, April 10, 2007, illustrated the hope stem cell research can offer in a speech on the Senate floor in favor of legislation to expand federal funding for stem cell research.  \n",
      "   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. \n",

Recall that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ measures the amount of information loss when $Q$ is used to approximate $P$. Here, the rows are the $P$s used for calculating KL divergences, and the columns are the $Q$s. So, each cell measures the amount of information loss when the word distribution of the column text is used to approximate the word distribution of the row text. Because the KL divergence is directional, such that the divergence of $P$ from $Q$ is different from the same of $Q$ from $P$, the matrix is assymetric and contains unique information above and below the diagonal. The same is true for the $\\chi^2$ divergence."
